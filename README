 - Most importantly, make sure the foreground and background are contrasting well and good typography is used
 - Sensible use of images and other multi-media formats.
* Hyperlinks
Use relative URLs to ensure portability
 - Make sure no broken images or broken links
* Appropriate use the following techniques and provide a README file (can be in plain text) to document the rationale and how you used them. This README file should also help the project marker to locate which pages contain the required technique.
* Form Controls

* Client-side Programming: Javascript - at least for basic form validation
* Due to possible incompability between browsers on rendering CSS positioning, page layout using tables is allowedPage Layout needs to be done by CSS positioning, no layout tables are allowed..
