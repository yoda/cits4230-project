h1. Blakstar Like

Simple plugin for handling positive and negative likes.
This stuff has been made for Blakstar cms and used in production, but released as a free solution.

h2. Examples

First, generate the migration file.
<pre><code>
script/generate blakstar_like_migration
</code></pre>

Include blakstar_like in a model you want to like.
<pre><code>Class Post < ActiveRecord::Base

  blakstar_like
  
end
</code></pre>

The following methods will be available:

<pre><code>
@post.like!( @user_1 )

@post.dislike!( @user_2 )

@post.average_like #=> 0

@post.count_likes! #=> 1

@post.count_dislikes! #=> 1
</code></pre>

h2. Caching

If you add two new fields to Post - :likes_count and :dislikes_count - the plugin
automatically caches the total number of likes / dislikes to speed up calculations.

h2. Development

The following features will be implemented:

# Specify custom caching fields
# Get all liked objects by user
# Get all disliked objects by user
# Get all objects by user whether it was liked or disliked.
